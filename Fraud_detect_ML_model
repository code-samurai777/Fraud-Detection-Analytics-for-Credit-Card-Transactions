## Model termcase

This model takes credit card transaction features as input
(amount, time, anonymized features like V1–V28, etc.)

Outputs one of two classes:

0 → Normal / Legit transaction
1 → Fraudulent transaction

So at runtime, it answers whether the given transaction’s pattern appears to be fraudulent or not.
